class WSSession extends EventEmitter {
	; So, the whole idea behind a websocket is that we're converting a HTTP connection into a websocket connection, reusing the
	;  existing connection. 
	; Which means we either need our HTTP socket to understand websockets (which is just flat out a bad idea), or we need
	;  to come up with a way to convert out HTTP socket into a websocket socket. Which is what this class does.

	; And this class accomplishes that. It acts as either an HTTP session, or a websocket session depening ong what's needed
	;  at the moment. So it is an HTTP session until we switch to the websocket protocol, then it is a websocket session
	;   from then one.
	
	; And since HTTPClient and WSClient both share the common base class of TCPSocket, and only depend on TCPSocket members, it is
	;  perfectly safe to just swap WSClient in for the base class of an existing HTTPClient and have TCPSocket members work
	;   just like before.
	; Effectively casting a HTTPClient to a WSClient.
